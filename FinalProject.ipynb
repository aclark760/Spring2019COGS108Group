    "The problem we are investigating is the cost increases of higher education and its relationship to the salaries from the obtained degrees. With the cost of obtaining a bachelor’s, masters’ and PhD increasing more than the previous one, is it really worth it to pursue a certain level of education? Also, the majors that are usually viewed as those that won’t earn you a lot, are they actually as lame as people think they are? For the project, we try to answer the question of 1. What type/category of majors and degrees cost you the most, and 2. Do these combinations also make you more money in the long run compared to other less expensive majors/ degrees.\n",
    "We expect that on average, degrees that require more time will have a better payoff in the long run due to the additional knowledge and skills gained from the additional education. However, there may be certain degrees, where having more industry experience will be better, and thus be proportionally more cost efficient."
