    "The problem we are investigating is the cost increases of higher education and its relationship to the salaries from the obtained degrees. With the cost of obtaining a bachelor’s degree, is it really worth it to pursue a certain level of education? Also, are the majors, or in our case groups of types of majors (later referred to as school type), that are usually viewed as those low-earning worth to pursue with a college degree? For the project, we try to answer the question of 1. What type/category of degrees at schools cost you the most, and 2. Do these combinations also make you more money in the long run compared to other less expensive bachelor degrees? 3. Does the school region and type of school have an effect on the starting and mid-career salaries of graduates?"

    "There is a large difference between college completion of high and low income families and between completion of college for females and males. In the NBER working papers, college completion is measured by people who attain a bachelor’s degree by the time they are 25. Over the years, there has been an increase in the completion of college for females, but this increase is driven by the daughters of high income families, and does not account for females in low-income families. Between 1915 and 1983, college completion quadrupled. Again, most of this increase is accounted for by high-income families. This begs the question, is the price of college too high for the regular household?\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon looking at another article about the worth of college, our group found that debt for college has become a large sum that often hinders students from living out their dreams. In fact, between 2010 and 2011, half of all of the college graduates were unemployed or employed below their skill level. If college isn’t getting students closer to what they want, then is it worth it? The article clarifies that for certain majors such as engineering or medical majors, college is necessary. It also singles out certain colleges, like Stanford, as being more worth it than others. However, overall, the book states that college is not necessary if one does not have a clear reason for going. Most people can go to the library and learn for themselves what their $100 grand plus would get them in college. To support this claim, the author states that 84% of employers have rated college graduates as not fully prepared for the workforce and only a little bit more prepared than a high school graduate.\n",
    "\n",
    "College costs have been rising at a rate above the rate of inflation. They will continue to follow this trend and students will become more and more crippled by debt for the same education. Additionally, more students are being enrolled in universities, thus creating a more people competing for the same amount of resources scenario at nearly all public and state colleges. The large difference in lifetime earnings between those with and without college degrees is largely due to what those who graduate from the top 150 colleges earn. Students from the average college do not have a large difference between their lifetime earnings after subtracting debt when compared to a high school graduate with no debt.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of education has always been a topic of discussion, but in recent years it has become more of a concern. Lots of data about such topics exist online. For example, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Kaggle, Payscale. Most people will complete a bachelor’s degree after 4 years of college. However, depending on which college you attend, the cost of a bachelor’s degree can vary significantly. By default, private universities cost more to attend compared to public universities, which may put more pressure on students to select the best major to make up for the cost. However, as noted in the analysis from College Earnings Premium & Value Proposition, if financial aid is included, the cost for attending private colleges becomes more comparable to the cost of public colleges.\n",
    "\n",
    "The type of major you select also can have a significant impact on your salary after you complete your degree. The analysis from the project Post-College Salaries Exploration in R, shows that STEM majors have an advantage when it comes to starting salaries and mid-career salaries. However, since we are looking at the proportional net gain from cost of attendance to salary, we cannot simply look at the top paying majors. Further analysis in the same project describes the growth in long-term salary for the various majors. In this case, engineering majors showed less growth compared to other majors such as economics, political science, finance, etc. While we do have to take into consideration the higher starting salary for engineering majors, the difference in growth potential suggests that non STEM majors may be worth considering when examining the net proportional gain after earning the degree.\n",

    "We expect that on average, engineering degrees will have a better payoff in the long run due to the strict knowledge and skills gained in school that cannot be learned out of an institution. However, there may be certain degrees, where having more industry experience will be better, and thus be proportionally more cost efficient. \n",

    "From the analysis above, we have concluded that the type of school and the region of the school both affect starting and mid-career salaries. Private schools tend to be more advantageous than public schools. Engineering majors are the most properous immediately after graduation only closely behind any degree earned at an Ivy League school. The next best are Liberal Arts, Party, and State schools respectively. When looking at regions, we found that schools in the Northeastern region are the best in terms of mid career salary and California is the second best. In terms of average starting salary, however, California ranks first and is followed by Northeastern. After that, Southern, Western, and Midwestern regions, respectively, follow in average starting and mid career salary. The last three regions have very minimal difference in their average starting salary.\n",
    "\n",
    "When looking at percent growth for school types, Ivy leagues showed the most average percent growth. Liberal arts had the 2nd best average percent growth. In fact, and contrary to our hypothesis, party, liberal art, and state schools had a higher percent growth than engineering schools that fell in last place for growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible limitations in our analysis arise from the fact that we did not include any institutions that had missing or withheld information. Also, by excluding smaller institutions, those with less than 2000 attendees, we had hoped to eliminate trade schools from our analysis. For the most part, this worked, however, a few arts and non-degree providing schools were still left in the data. Due to the large amount of data we had, we were unable to fully remove all trade schools (we could not go through them one-by-one). This may have skewed our data slightly and should be kept in mind when observing our analysis."
